![Modelio Modeler](README/logo-modelio-v4.png)

Modelio is a modeling solution offering a wide range of functionalities based on the main standards of enterprise architecture, software development and systems engineering.

[![Modelio Documentations](README/documentation-link.png)](https://github.com/ModelioOpenSource/Modelio/wiki)

Dedicated to developers, analysts and software and systems architects, Modelio is first and foremost a modeling environment, supporting a wide range of models and diagrams and providing many services facilitating the modeling of your architectures such as as model consistency checking features. Support for modeling and business processes (BPMN) is integrated into Modelio. These BPMN models can be linked to other standards supported by the tool, for example UML, so as to integrate these business processes into a larger context such as an enterprise architecture.
