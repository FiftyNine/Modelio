= Introduction

Since its 3.7 version, Modelio introduces a new support of BPMN 2.0 in order to stick to the practices of the BPMN Analysts.

* The Modelio BPMN metamodel is slightly modified.
* Modelio BPMN creation and manipulation GUI is modified:
** Diagrams
** Diagram manipulation (editing contents)
** Model browser organization

Modelio can open and automatically migrate any Modelio 3.6 BPMN model.
