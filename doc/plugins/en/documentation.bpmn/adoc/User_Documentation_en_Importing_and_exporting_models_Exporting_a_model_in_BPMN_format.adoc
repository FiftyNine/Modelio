The BPMN Export service is used to generate BPMN files from a BPMN model built in Modelio.

To export a BPMN model :

2. Use the *Import / Export > Export > Export BPMN* contextual command.

*Steps:*

1. Select the BPMN model.
2. Run the *Import/Export > Import > BPMN export* command.
3. Choose a name for the exported file.
4. Click on Save to validate and launch the export process.

*Note:* Some BPMN models might need to be normalized before export. Make sure your model is in *read/write* mode before launching the command.
