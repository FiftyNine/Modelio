= Modelio ArchiMate views


In ArchiMate *views* are a partial representation of the model, just like UML diagrams. They are pictures of a set of model element displayed together according to business, user profile or interest criteria.

In Modelio, ArchiMate viewsa are always organized in <<User_Documentation_en_os_ArchimateModel.adoc#,ViewPoints>>. They intend to convey information about a specific part of the model for specific stakeholdes, with a particular purpose.

[[HArchiMateglobalview]]
= ArchiMate global view

The easiest way to create ArchiMate model in Modelio is through an ArchiMate global view.

It is used to create any kind of ArchiMate elements, regardless of their layer. As soon as a new element is created in the view, it is automatically attached to the corresponding layer in the model itself.

This view is used to create any kind of ArchiMate elements, regardless of their layer. As soon as a new element is created in the view, it is automatically attached to the corresponding layer in the model itself.

[[HArchiMateViewPointdiagram]]
=  ArchiMate View Point diagram

In Modelio, viewpoints might contain numerous ArchiMate views, but ViewPoint diagrams exist to have an instant overview of all these diagrams.

A View Point diagram automatically displays:

* thumbnails for each ArchiMate views existing as siblings of the View Point diagram.
* child View Points of the diagram's owner View Point.

In a nutshell, a View Point diagram can be used as a graphical table of contents, making easy to find a specific view even in a huge model...

*Note:* Double click on a thumbnail to open the corresponding view.

== Configuring a View Point diagram

When selecting a View Point diagram, some layout configuration becomes available in the symbol view:

It is used to create any kind of ArchiMate elements, regardless of their layer. As soon as a new element is created in the view, it is automatically attached to the corresponding layer in the model itself.

*Note:* When the ArchiMate model is part of a SVN fragment, using the "Get Lock" or "Commit" commands on the view itself with the "recursive" option checked applies to the view AND all elements displayed in it.

[[HAutomaticlayout]]
=== Automatic layout

With the automatic layout on, all elements are organized in a table. The number of columns can be edited according to your needs, as well as the default size for all elements.

The diagram only accepts creation of View Points and ArchiMate views, it should not be possible to unmask anything else in it.

[[HManuallayout]]
=== Manual layout

With the automatic layout off, it becomes possible to unmask only a subset of views or sub View Points in the diagram, instead of displaying all of them.

It can also be used to simply change the diagram's general organization, grouping views by whatever criteria you want rather than having them in the model's order.
