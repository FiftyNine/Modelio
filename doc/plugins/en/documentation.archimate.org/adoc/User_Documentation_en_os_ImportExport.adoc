Modelio offers a feature to exchange ArchiMate models defined with the Open Group ArchiMate Model Exchange File Format. This will allow you to exchange models with other modeling tools such as Archi.

[[HSupportedformatandversions]]
= Supported format and versions

The ArchiMate exchange feature supports the 2.1 and 3.0 ArchiMate Model Exchange File Format, as defined by the Open Group (https://www.opengroup.org/xsd/archimate/),

A snapshot version of the 3.1 Model Exchange File Format is also supported, despite the format currently being under development. Therefore, it might not be fully compatible with other tools till the format is officially release by the Open Group.
