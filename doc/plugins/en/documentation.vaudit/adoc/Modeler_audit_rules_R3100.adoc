===== Tips

If you have a subprocess sequence that has _SequenceFlows_ coming out of or leading out of the subprocess, you should keep in mind that a subprocess should have a _StartEvent_ and an _EndEvent_, and only one sequence. These rules should ensure that you do not have any coming out of or leading out of the subprocess.
