Enumerations cannot be broken down and therefore should be always primitive.

In Modelio Enumerations are primitive by default. Only a module or a macro can modify this state.

===== Tips

* Contact the developer of the module or the macro which created or modified the Enumeration, and ask him to fix its code.
* If you are the developer, call setIsElementary(true)on the enumeration, and check that you are not calling setIsElementary(false)on it.
